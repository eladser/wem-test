# ‚úÖ PostgreSQL Migration Success Checklist

## Pre-Migration Verification
- [ ] PostgreSQL server is running
- [ ] Connection string is correct in appsettings.json
- [ ] User `wem_admin` exists and has proper permissions
- [ ] Repository is cleaned up (ran cleanup scripts)

## Migration Execution
- [ ] Navigated to `backend/src/WemDashboard.Infrastructure`
- [ ] Dropped existing database (if any)
- [ ] Removed old migrations
- [ ] Created new `InitialPostgreSQLMigration`
- [ ] Applied migration successfully
- [ ] No DateTime casting errors occurred

## Post-Migration Verification

### Database Structure
- [ ] Database `wemdashboard` exists
- [ ] Table `Sites` created with proper columns
- [ ] Table `Devices` created with foreign key to Sites
- [ ] Table `EnergyReadings` created with foreign key to Devices
- [ ] Table `Alerts` created with foreign key to Sites
- [ ] `__EFMigrationsHistory` table exists

### Column Types Verification
- [ ] All DateTime columns use `timestamp with time zone`
- [ ] All decimal columns use `decimal(18,6)` precision
- [ ] String columns have proper length constraints
- [ ] Foreign key relationships are correctly established

### Indexes Verification
- [ ] Unique index on Sites.Name
- [ ] Index on EnergyReadings.Timestamp
- [ ] Composite index on EnergyReadings (DeviceId, Timestamp)
- [ ] Primary key indexes on all tables

### Application Testing
- [ ] Backend API starts without migration errors
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend successfully
- [ ] Can create new Sites
- [ ] Can create new Devices
- [ ] Can create new EnergyReadings
- [ ] Can create new Alerts
- [ ] No DateTime casting exceptions in logs

## Performance Verification
- [ ] Database queries execute in reasonable time
- [ ] Indexes are being used efficiently
- [ ] Connection pooling works correctly
- [ ] No memory leaks in Entity Framework

## Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Added seed data back (if needed)
- [ ] Created additional indexes for performance
- [ ] Set up database backup strategy
- [ ] Configured connection string for production

## Troubleshooting Completed
- [ ] No "Cannot convert DateTime to String" errors
- [ ] No PostgreSQL connection issues
- [ ] No Entity Framework configuration errors
- [ ] No migration rollback needed

## Final Verification Commands

### Check Migration Status
```bash
dotnet ef migrations list --startup-project ../WemDashboard.API --context WemDashboardDbContext
```

### Verify Database Schema
```sql
\dt -- List tables
\d "Sites" -- Describe Sites table
\d "Devices" -- Describe Devices table
\d "EnergyReadings" -- Describe EnergyReadings table
\d "Alerts" -- Describe Alerts table
```

### Test Application
```bash
# Start backend
cd backend/src/WemDashboard.API
dotnet run

# Start frontend (in another terminal)
npm run dev
```
